Remote Access
=============
Behaviors that provide an attacker with potentially full access to the system via a remote network connection. For example, an attacker may choose to delete files or corrupt data, poweroff the machine, or upload and execute other applications. 

Behaviors implemented in the malware code should be captured by explicit behaviors (e.g., [Capture Video](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/discovery/capture-video.md), [Destroy Data](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/effects/destroy-data.md)), but actions that result from an attacker with remote access (e.g., a command line interface) would be reflected by this Remote Access behavior. 

Malware Examples
