Emulator Evasion
================
Behaviors that obstruct analysis in an emulator.

Methods
-------
Different Opcode Sets: Use different opcodes sets (ex: FPU, MMX, SSE) to block emulators.
Undocumented Opcodes: Use rare or undocumented opcodes to block non-exhaustive emulators.
Unusual/Undocumented API Calls: Call unusual APIs to block non-exhaustive emulators (particularly anti-virus).
Extra Loops/Time Locks: Add extra loops to make time-constraint emulators give up.
Secure Triggers: Code and/or data is encrypted until the underlying system satisfies a preselected condition unknown to the analyst (this is a form of Deposited Keys).
Malloc Use: Instead of unpacking into a pre-defined section/segment (ex: .text) of the binary, uses malloc()/VirtualAlloc() to create a new segment. This makes keeping track of memory locations across different runs more difficult, as there is no guarantee that malloc/VirtualAlloc will assign the same address range each time.
