Dynamic Analysis Evasion
========================
Behaviors that obstruct dynamic analysis in a sandbox, emulator, or virtual machine. Emulator-specific evasion behaviors are defined in [Emulator Evasion](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/emulator-evade.md). Dynamic analysis evasion may prevent detection in detonation chambers.

Methods
-------
* **Data Flood**: Overloads a sandbox by generating a flood of meaningless behavioral data. [[2]](#2)
* **Delayed Execution** - Stalling code is typically executed before any malicious behavior. The malware's aim is to delay the execution of the malicious activity long enough so that an automated dynamic analysis system fails to extract the interesting malicious behavior. 
* **Demo Mode**: Inclusion of a demo binary/mode that is executed when token is absent or not enough privileged.
* **Deposited Keys**: Parts of the code and/or data is encrypted or otherwise relies on data external to the file itself. For example, malware that contains code that is encrypted with a key that is downloaded from a server; malware that only runs if certain other software is installed on the system; or malware that reads certain attributes of the system (BIOS version string, hostname, etc) and then encrypts portions of its code or data using those attributes as input, thus preventing itself from being able to be run on a different system (e.g., sandbox, emulator, etc.).
* **Drop Code**: Original file is written to disk then executed. May confuse some sandboxes, especially if the dropped executable must be provided specific arguments and the original dropper is not associated with the drop file(s).
* **Encode File**: Encode a file on disk, such as an implant's config file.
* **GetVolumeInformation**: This Windows API call is used to get the GUID on a system drive. Malware compares it to a previous (targeted) GUID value and only executes maliciously if they match. This behavior can be mitigated in non-automated analysis environments.
* **Hook File System**: do something when particular file/dir is accessed; often through hooking certain API calls such as CreateFileA and CreateFileW.
* **Hook Interrupt**: modification of interrupt vector or descriptor tables.
* **Host Fingerprint Check**: Compare a previously computed host fingerprint(e.g., based on installed applications) to the current system's to determine if the malware instance is still executing on the same system. If not, execution stops, making debugging or sandbox analysis more difficult.
* **Illusion**: Creates an illusion; makes the analyst think something happened when it didn't.
* **Secure Triggers**: Code and/or data is encrypted until the underlying system satisfies a preselected condition unknown to the analyst (this is a form of Deposited Keys).
* **Timing/Date Checks**: Calling GetSystemTime or equiv and only executing code if the current date/hour/minute/second passes some check. Often this is for running only after or only until a specific date. This behavior can be mitigated in non-automated analysis environments.
* **Timing/Uptime Check**: Comparing single GetTickCount with some value to see if system has been started at least *X* amount ago. This behavior can be mitigated in non-automated analysis environments.
* **Token Check**: Presence check to allow the program to run (ex: dongle, CD/DVD, key, file, network, etc.). If the token is specific to a hardware element (ex: disk, OS, CPU, NIC MAC, etc.), it is considered fingerprinting.
