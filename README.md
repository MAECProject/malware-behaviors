# Malware Behavior Catalog #
The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is a catalog of malware Objectives and Behaviors. 

### Objectives ###
As shown below, malware Objectives are based on [ATT&CK Tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/), tailored for the malware analysis use case. Two malware analysis-specific Objectives (Anti-Behavioral Analysis and Anti-Static Analysis) are also defined. 

### Behaviors ###
Under each Objective, the MBC captures all Behaviors relating to malware analysis with links to [ATT&CK Techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/) when possible. Names of MBC Behaviors may or may not match related ATT&CK Techniques. Any content provided on Behavior pages is *supplemental* to ATT&CK content. In other words, ATT&CK content is not duplicated in the MBC, but MBC users will want to reference ATT&CK while capturing malware Behaviors.

### Example Malware ###
The MBC also contains a collection of [example malware](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/xample-malware/). Examples are associated with malware Behaviors.

## Malware Objective Descriptions ##
Malware Objectives are defined below. Follow the links to view associated Behaviors.

|**Objective**|**Description**|
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|[**Anti-Behavioral Analysis**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/README.md) |Malware aims to prevent, obstruct, or evade behavioral analysis done in a sandbox, debugger, etc.|
|[**Anti-Static Analysis**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/anti-static-analysis/README.md)| Malware aims to prevent static analysis or make it more difficult. Simpler static analysis identifies features such as embedded strings, executable header information, hash values, and file metadata. More involved static analysis involves the disassembly of the binary code.|
|[**Collection**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/collection/README.md) | Malware aims to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This objective includes locations on a system or network where the malware may look for information to exfiltrate.|
|[**Command and Control**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/command-and-control/README.md) |Malware aims to communicate (receive and/or execute remotely submitted commands) with systems under its control within a target network.|
|[**Credential Access**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/credential-access/README.md)|Malware aims to obtain credential access, allowing it or its underlying threat actor to assume control of an account, with the associated system and network permissions.|
|[**Defense Evasion**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/defense-evasion/README.md)|Malware aims to evade detection or avoid other cybersecurity defenses.|
|[**Discovery**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/discovery/README.md)|Malware aims to gain knowledge about the system and internal network.|
|[**Effects**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/effects/README.md)|Malware aims to execute its mission.|
|[**Execution**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/execution/README.md)|Malware aims to execute it's code on a system to achieve secondary objectives in conjunction with its primary objectives.|
|[**Exfiltration**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/exfiltration/README.md)|  Malware aims to steal data from the system on which it executes. This includes stored data (e.g., files) as well as data input into applications (e.g., web browser).|
|[**Initial Access**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/initial-access/README.md)| Malware aims to gain an initial foothold within a system. The Objective may encompass aspects that are done independently of the malware.|
|[**Lateral Movement**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/lateral-movement/README.md)|Malware aims to propagate through the infection of a system or is able to infect a file after executing on a system. The malware may infect actively (e.g., gain access to a machine directly) or passively (e.g., send malicious email).|
|[**Persistence**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/persistence/README.md)|Malware aims to remain on a system regardless of system events.|
|[**Privilege Escalation**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/privilege-escalation/README.md)|Malware aims to obtain a higher level of permission.|
