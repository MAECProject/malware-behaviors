# Malware Behavior Catalog
The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is a catalog of malware objectives and behaviors. Some Malware Objectives defined in MBC overlap with ATT&CK Tactics.

|**Objective**|**Description**|
|-------------|---------------|
|[**Anti-Behavioral Analysis**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/README.md) |Behaviors that prevent, obstruct, or evade behavioral analysis (sandbox, debugger, etc).|
|[**Anti-Static Analysis**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/anti-static-analysis/README.md)|Behaviors that prevent static analysis or make it more difficult. Simpler static analysis identifies features such as embedded strings, header information, hash values, and file metadata (e.g., creation date). More involved static analysis involves the disassembly of the binary code.|
|**Collection**|Behaviors that identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This objective includes locations on a system or network where the malware may look for information to exfiltrate.|
|**Command and Control**|Behaviors that communicate (receive and/or execute remotely submitted commands) with systems under its control within a target network.|
|**Credential Access**|Behaviors leading to credential access, allowing the underlying threat actor to assume control of the account, with the associated system and network permissions.|
|**Defense Evasion**|Behaviors that evade detection or avoid other defenses.|
|**Initial Access**|Behaviors that gain an initial foothold within a machine or network.|
