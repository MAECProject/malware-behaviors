# Malware Behavior Catalog
The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is a catalog of malware objectives and behaviors. Some Malware Objectives defined in MBC overlap with ATT&CK Tactics.

|-------|-----|
|**Objective**|**Description**|
|[**Behavioral Analysis Evasion**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/README.md)|Behaviors that prevent, obstruct, or evade behavioral analysis (sandbox, debugger, etc).|
|[**Static Analysis Evasion**](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/anti-static-analysis/README.md)|Behaviors that prevent static analysis or make it more difficult. Simpler static analysis identifies features such as embedded strings, header information, hash values, and file metadata (e.g., creation date). More involved static analysis involves the disassembly of the binary code.|
|**Collection**|Behaviors that identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This objective includes locations on a system or network where the malware may look for information to exfiltrate.|
|**Command and Control**|Behaviors to communicate with systems under its control within a target network. There are many ways malware can establish command and control with various levels of covertness, depending on system configuration and network topology.|
|**Credential Access**||
