# Frequently Asked Questions # 

* **We have [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) - why do we need the Malware Behavior Catalog?**

The objective of the Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is to (eventually) define *all* malware behaviors, those defined by ATT&CK, as well as those outside ATT&CK's scope. As a consolidated malware behaviors resource, the MBC aims to directly and explicitly identify malware behaviors to support malware analysis-oriented use cases. 

* **Why not merge malware behaviors into ATT&CK?**

It's not reasonable to expect ATT&CK to expand to cover *all* problem spaces, the malware analysis space included. However, MBC leverages ATT&CK as much as possible.

* **What should I do if no MBC behavior is defined for something I need to capture?**

The MBC will evolve to support the malware analysis community. If you have a suggestion for a new behavior (or any content change), please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/issues).

* **How should Methods be used?**

"Methods" are given to help explain behaviors, and they aren't intended to be referenced in analyses in the same way that behaviors are. In part, this is because it would be hard to enumerate all methods associated with a behavior. However, MBC exists to support malware analysis--eventually, methods could be expanded and refined to serve as "sub-behaviors" if the community expresses the need.

* **If malware displays only some characteristics defining a behavior, it is correct to say it exhibits the behavior?**

Yes. In many cases, malware will display only a subset of behavior characteristics. For example, the [System Information Discovery](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/discovery/system-info-discovery.md) behavior includes discovery of a hostname, operating system version, patch information, processor architecture, etc. Malware that gathers only a hostname would still be said to exhibit the behavior.
