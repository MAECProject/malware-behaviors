# Frequently Asked Questions # 

* **We have [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) - why is the Malware Behavior Catalog needed?**

The objective of the Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is to (eventually) define *all* malware behaviors, those defined by ATT&CK, as well as those outside ATT&CK's scope. As a consolidated malware behaviors resource, the MBC aims to directly and explicitly identify malware behaviors to support malware analysis-oriented use cases. 

* **Why not merge malware behaviors into ATT&CK?**

It's not realistic to expect ATT&CK to expand to cover *all* problem spaces, including the malware analysis problem space. However, MBC leverages ATT&CK as much as possible.

* **What should I do if no MBC behavior is defined for something I need to capture?**

The MBC will evolve to support the malware analysis community. If you have a suggestion for a new behavior (or any content change), please open a [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/issues).

* **How should Methods be used?**

"Methods" are given to help explain behaviors, and they aren't intended to be referenced in analyses in the same way that behaviors are. In part, this is because it would be hard to enumerate all methods associated with a behavior. However, MBC exists to support malware analysis--eventually, methods could be expanded and refined to serve as "sub-behaviors" if the community expresses the need.

* **If malware displays only a portion of an MBC behavior, it is correct to say it has the behavior?**

Yes. In many cases, malware will display only a subset of a defined behavior. For example, malware that gathers only a hostname would still be said to have the [System Information Discovery](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/discovery/system-info-discovery.md) behavior.
