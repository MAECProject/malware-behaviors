# Frequently Asked Questions # 

* **What should I do if there is no MBC behavior defined for something I need to capture?**

The MBC will evolve to support the malware analysis community. If you have a suggestion for a new behavior (or any content change), please open a [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/issues).

* **If malware behavior displays only a portion of an MBC behavior, it is correct to say it has the behavior?**

Yes. In many cases, malware will display only a subset of a defined behavior. For example, malware that gathers only a hostname would still be said to have the [System Information Discovery](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/defense-evasion/system-info-discovery.md) behavior.
