# Frequently Asked Questions # 

* **Why is the Malware Behavior Catalog needed?**

The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) is a consolidated malware behavior resource. The more directly and explicitly malware behavior identification can be addressed, the more useful it will be to malware analysts. MBC contains ALL malware behaviors, including techniques defined in ATT&CK, which are referenced via links. 

* **Why not merge malware behaviors into ATT&CK?**

It's not realistic to expect ATT&CK to expand to cover *all* problem spaces, including the malware analysis problem space. However, MBC leverages ATT&CK as much as possible.

* **What should I do if no MBC behavior is defined for something I need to capture?**

The MBC will evolve to support the malware analysis community. If you have a suggestion for a new behavior (or any content change), please open a [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/issues).

* **How should Methods be used?**

"Methods" are given to help explain behaviors, and they aren't intended to be referenced in analyses in the same way that behaviors are. In part, this is because it would be hard to enumerate all Methods associated with a behavior. However, MBC exists to support malware analysis so eventually, Methods could be expanded and refined to serve as "sub-behaviors" if the community expresses the need.

* **If malware displays only a portion of an MBC behavior, it is correct to say it has the behavior?**

Yes. In many cases, malware will display only a subset of a defined behavior. For example, malware that gathers only a hostname would still be said to have the [System Information Discovery](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/discovery/system-info-discovery.md) behavior.
