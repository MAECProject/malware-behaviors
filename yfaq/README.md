 # Malware Behavior Catalog Frequently Asked Questions # 

* **We have [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org), so why do we need the Malware Behavior Catalog?**

As a consolidated malware behaviors resource, The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) aims to directly and explicitly define malware behaviors and code characteristics to support malware analysis-oriented use cases. MBC includes behaviors defined by ATT&CK, as well as those outside ATT&CK's scope. 

The identification of most malware behaviors will come via analysis, either direct analysis or from outside reporting or threat feeds. The understanding and identification of standardized behaviors supports typical malware-related use cases: detection (signature-heuristic generation), mitigation and remediation, attribution, provenance and similarity scoring, and standardized reporting. 

* **Why not merge malware behaviors into ATT&CK?**

It's not reasonable to expect ATT&CK to expand to cover *all* problem spaces, including the malware analysis space. As stated in the ATT&CK design and philosophy document [[1]](#1), "The basis of ATT&CK is the set of individual techniques that represent actions that adversaries can perform to accomplish objectives." This differs from the malware community's need to capture information discovered during *analysis* of malware code. 

While malware sometimes acts as a surrogate for an adversary (i.e., there is overlap between malware and adversary behavior), there are aspects unique to malware, mostly notably anti-analysis characteristics that are only identified during analysis: [Anti-Behavioral Analysis](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/anti-behavioral-analysis) and [Anti-Static Analysis](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/anti-static-analysis). Some MBC behaviors may be appropriate for inclusion in ATT&CK, but it is up to the ATT&CK team to identify them and integrate the content.

* **Why does MBC include ATT&CK Techniques? Why not create a stand-alone supplement to ATT&CK?**

To most effectively support malware analysis, MBC aims to provide a complete set of malware-related behaviors. Consequently, MBC defines new, malware-related behaviors, but also leverages ATT&CK as much as possible, identifying the reduced set of ATT&CK techniques pertaining to malware.

* **Is there a formal relationship between ATT&CK and MBC?**

No. Given that MBC is an extension of ATT&CK, we have consulted with the ATT&CK team to keep them apprised of our work, but there is no formal relationship between ATT&CK and MBC. While content of MBC was not coordinated with the ATT&CK team, we borrowed from ATT&CK's philosophy and methodology [[1]](#1). Namely, MBC will maintain a malware, code-oriented perspective; focus on real-world use of behaviors through empirical malware examples, drawing upon publicly available analysis and reporting; and maintain a level of abstraction appropriate for supporting malware analysis use cases (e.g., develop malware signatures, mitigate infection, drive analytics, attribution).  

* **What is the relationship between MAEC, EMA, and MBC?**

In short, the [Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC)](http://maecproject.github.io/) led to the [Encyclopedia of Malware Attributes (EMA)](https://collaborate.mitre.org/ema/index.php/ema:Main_Page), which led to the Malware Behavior Catalog.

MAEC is a community-developed structured language for encoding and sharing high-fidelity information about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and relationships between malware samples. The vocabularies associated with MAEC define malware capabilities and behaviors, which are further defined and specified in EMA, along with "behavior instances" that capture specific malware instances/families exhibiting behaviors.

After noting clear overlap between EMA and ATT&CK, we initially decided that EMA would only capture malware behaviors *not* captured by ATT&CK (primarily anti-analysis behaviors). However, ATT&CK defines many techniques not-applicable to malware, so to provide a well-defined, single collection of *malware* behaviors, MBC was created. MBC differs from EMA in that MBC was created in ATT&CK's image with the hope that by following ATT&CK's philosophy and methodology, MBC would be more useful and readily adopted (see previous question). 

* **Can Behaviors be used separately? Or must Capabilities and Behaviors be specified in pairs?**

Capabilities correspond to the intentions behind malware Behaviors. For example, malware may use [Hooking](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/credential-access/hooking.md) to load and execute code within the context of another process either to hide its execution (defense evasion), to gain elevated privileges (privilege escalation), or to access the process's memory (credential access). Because it's not always possible to know intent, Behaviors can be used separately. For example, automated sandbox analysis may indicate hooking behavior without corresponding information on intent, in which case capabilities might not be specified or *all* capabilities associated with a Behavior might be noted.

* **How were MBC Behaviors identified?**

Many MBC Behaviors stemmed from the MAEC and EMA work, with the collection evolving to mesh with ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques. We also identified MBC Behaviors by studying publicly available analyses, reports, and output of automated analysis engines (some of which map behavior indicators to ATT&CK). Such resources enabled identification of malware-related ATT&CK Techniques, as well as definition of new Behaviors for results that could not be mapped to ATT&CK. Also - EMA Behaviors for which a real-world example could not be found are captured as proof-of-concept in the [Theoretical Behavior List](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/theoretical-behaviors). 

* **Do malware behaviors and adversary behaviors overlap?**

Sometimes malware behaviors and adversary behaviors overlap because adversaries sometimes use malware to achieve their goals. However, MBC only captures behaviors associated with malware code. In other words, MBC Behaviors are identified through analysis of a malware sample's binary code or by observing the malware on a network, whereas adversary behaviors may be derived from a variety of indicators on a system or network. 

* **Some MBC Behaviors seem to be characteristics of code, not actual behaviors (e.g., [Code Optimization](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/anti-static-analysis/code-optimize.md)). Why are they captured and why are they called "behaviors"?**

MBC captures traits of malware that are evident through analysis and that support one or more malware analysis use cases. Capturing a characteristic such as Code Optimization supports use cases such as attribution and detection by indicating that optimization has been used to make the code harder to analyze. 

* **Why aren't [Pre-ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/pre/) Techniques used by malware authors included in MBC? For example, why doesn't the [Obfuscate or Encrypt Code](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1319/) Technique under the [Adversary OPSEC](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0021/) Tactic apply to malware showing signs of anti-analysis techniques?**

MBC captures behaviors associated with malware executable *code*. It does not capture human behaviors, even if the behaviors relate to malware.

* **If MBC Behaviors must be associated with malware code, why are [Initial Access](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/initial-access) Behaviors captured?**

Initial Access Behaviors with an explicit malware component are captured in MBC. For example, in the [Spearphishing Attachment](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/initial-access/spearphishing-attach.md) Behavior, it's assumed that the attachment corresponds to a malware file; in the [Exploit Public Facing Application](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/initial-access/exploit-public-facing-app.md) Behavior, it's assumed that malware is performing the exploit. Because some malware is strongly associated with particular types of initial access, capturing access details is necessary to fully summarize its characteristics. Also, some Initial Access Behaviors overlap with malware propagation behaviors.

* **Why do MBC Behavior names not always match ATT&CK Technique names?**

MBC maintains a malware, code-oriented perspective, so MBC behavior names will not always match related ATT&CK names (although they usually do).

* **What if no MBC behavior is defined for something I need to capture?**

The MBC will continually evolve to better support the malware analysis community. If you have a suggestion for a new behavior (or any content change), please open an [issue](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/issues) on GitHub.

* **How should information in the Methods section be used?**

"Methods" are variations of a behavior and are provided to help explain Behaviors. Methods aren't intended to be referenced in analyses in the same way that Behaviors are. In part, this is because it would be hard to enumerate all Methods associated with a Behavior. 

However, MBC exists to support malware analysis so eventually, Methods could be expanded and refined to serve as "sub-behaviors," if the community expresses the need. If we determine that expansion of Methods is warranted, it may be that they are used for manual mapping of behaviors while the higher-level behaviors are used by automated analysis systems (which is not to say that some Methods could not be identified automatically).

* **If malware displays only some characteristics defining a Behavior, it is correct to say it exhibits the Behavior?**

Yes. In many cases, malware will display only a subset of a Behavior's characteristics. For example, the [System Information Discovery](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/discovery/system-info-discovery.md) Behavior includes discovery of a hostname, operating system version, patch information, processor architecture, etc. Malware that gathers only a hostname would still be said to exhibit the System Information Discovery Behavior.
