# Malware Behavior Catalog Frequently Asked Questions # 

* **We have [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org), so why do we need the Malware Behavior Catalog?**

As a consolidated malware behaviors resource, The Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) aims to directly and explicitly define malware behaviors and code characteristics to support malware analysis-oriented use cases. MBC includes behaviors defined by ATT&CK, as well as those outside ATT&CK's scope. The identification of most malware behaviors will come via analysis, either direct analysis or from outside reporting or threat feeds. The understanding and identification of standardized behaviors supports typical malware-related use cases: detection (signature-heuristic generation), mitigation and remediation, attribution, provenance and similarity scoring, and standardized reporting. 

* **Why not merge malware behaviors into ATT&CK?**

It's not reasonable to expect ATT&CK to expand to cover *all* problem spaces, including the malware analysis space. As stated in the ATT&CK design and philosophy document [[1]](#1), "The basis of ATT&CK is the set of individual techniques that represent actions that adversaries can perform to accomplish objectives." This differs from the malware community's need to capture information discovered during *analysis* of malware. While malware sometimes acts as a surrogate for an adversary (i.e., there is overlap between malware and adversary behavior), there are aspects unique to malware, mostly notably anti-analysis characteristics, which are only identified during analysis: [Anti-Behavioral Analysis](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/anti-behavioral-analysis) and [Anti-Static Analysis](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/anti-static-analysis). Some MBC behaviors may be appropriate for ATT&CK, but it is up to the ATT&CK team to identify them and integrate the content.

* **Why does MBC include ATT&CK Techniques? Why not create only a supplement to ATT&CK?**

To support more effective malware analysis, MBC defines new, malware-related behaviors and also leverages ATT&CK as much as possible. By identifying the subset of ATT&CK techniques pertaining to malware, MBC's provides a reduced, malware-focused set of options, making analysis easier.

* **Is there a formal relationship between ATT&CK and the MBC?**

No. The MBC is an extension of ATT&CK, and we have consulted with the ATT&CK team to keep them apprised of our work, but there is no formal relationship between ATT&CK and the MBC. While content of the MBC was not coordinated with the ATT&CK team, we borrowed from ATT&CK's philosophy and methodology [[1]](#1). Namely, the MBC will maintain a malware, code-oriented perspective (i.e., what does the malware do?); focus on real-world use of behaviors through empirical malware examples, drawing upon publicly available analysis and reporting; and maintain a level of abstraction appropriate for supporting malware analysis use cases (e.g., develop malware signatures, mitigate infection, drive analytics, attribution).  

* **What is the relationship between MAEC, EMA, and the MBC?**

The [Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC)](http://maecproject.github.io/) led to the [Encyclopedia of Malware Attributes (EMA)](https://collaborate.mitre.org/ema/index.php/ema:Main_Page), which led to the Malware Behavior Catalog.

MAEC is a community-developed structured language for encoding and sharing high-fidelity information about malware based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and relationships between malware samples. The vocabularies associated with MAEC define malware capabilities and behaviors, which are further defined and specified in EMA, along with "behavior instances" that capture specific malware instances/families exhibiting the behavior.

After noting the clear overlap between EMA and ATT&CK, we initially decided to use EMA to capture only malware behaviors not captured by ATT&CK (primarily anti-analysis behaviors). However, ATT&CK defines many techniques not-applicable to malware, so to provide a well-defined, single collection of *malware* behaviors, the MBC was created. The MBC differs from EMA in that the MBC was created in ATT&CK's image with the hope that by following ATT&CK's philosophy and methodology, the MBC would be more readily adopted (see previous question). 

* **Should Capabilities and Behaviors be used in pairs? Or can Behaviors be used separately?**

A Capability capture the intent of a malware Behavior. For example, malware may use [Hooking](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/credential-access/hooking.md) to load and execute code within the context of another process either to hide its execution, gain elevated privileges, or to access the process's memory (credential access). Automated analysis in a sandbox may indicate hooking behavior without corresponding information on intent (the underlying Capability). Therefore, some use cases may use Behaviors but not Capabilities (or may list all possible Capabilities).

* **How were MBC Behaviors identified?**

Many MBC Behaviors evolved from the MAEC and EMA work that were refined to satisfy the requirement of being exhibited by real-world malware. In addition, we captured behaviors reported in the wild through publicly available analyses, reports, and output of automated analysis engines (some of which map behavior indicators to ATT&CK). We captured corresponding ATT&CK Techniques, and we defined new Behaviors for results that could not be mapped to ATT&CK. Furthermore, any EMA Behaviors for which a real-world example could not be found are captured as proof-of-concept in the [Theoretical Behavior List](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/theoretical-behaviors). 

* **Do malware behaviors and adversary behaviors overlap?**

Sometimes malware behaviors and adversary behaviors overlap because adversaries sometimes use malware to achieve their goals. However, the MBC only captures behaviors associated with malware code. In other words, MBC Behaviors are identified through analysis of a malware sample's binary code or by observing the malware on a network, whereas adversary behaviors may be derived from a variety of indicators on a system or network. 

* **Some MBC Behaviors seem to be characteristics of code, not actual behaviors (e.g., Code Optimization). Why are they captured and why are they called "behaviors"?**

The MBC captures traits of malware that are evident through analysis and that support one or more malware analysis use cases. Capturing a characteristic such as Code Optimization support static code analysis by indicating that optimization has been used to make the code harder to analyze. 

* **Why aren't [Pre-ATT&CK Techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/pre/) used by malware authors included in the MBC? For example, why doesn't the [Obfuscate or Encrypt Code](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1319/) Technique under the [Adversary OPSEC](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0021/) Tactic apply to malware showing signs of anti-analysis techniques?**

The MBC captures behaviors associated with malware executable *code*. It does not capture human behaviors, even if the behaviors relate to malware.

* **If MBC Behaviors must be reflected in the malware code, why are [Initial Access](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/initial-access) Behaviors captured?**

Initial Access Behaviors with an explicit malware component are captured in the MBC. For example, in the [Spearphishing Attachment](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/initial-access/spearphishing-attach.md) Behavior, it's assumed that the attachment corresponds to a malware file; in the [Exploit Public Facing Application](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/initial-access/exploit-public-facing-app.md) Behavior, it's assumed malware is performing the exploit. Because some malware is strongly associated with particular types of initial access, capturing access details is necessary to fully summarize its characteristics. Also, some Initial Access Behaviors overlap with malware propagation behaviors.

* **Why do MBC behavior names not always match ATT&CK technique names?**

Because the MBC maintains a malware, code-oriented perspective, MBC behavior names will not always match related ATT&CK names (although they usually do).

* **What if no MBC behavior is defined for something I need to capture?**

The MBC will continually evolve to better support the malware analysis community. If you have a suggestion for a new behavior (or any content change), please open an [issue](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/issues) on GitHub.

* **How should information in the Methods section be used?**

"Methods" are variations of a behavior and are provided to help explain Behaviors. Methods aren't intended to be referenced in analyses in the same way that Behaviors are. In part, this is because it would be hard to enumerate all methods associated with a behavior. However, MBC exists to support malware analysis so eventually, methods could be expanded and refined to serve as "sub-behaviors" if the community expresses the need. If we determine that expansion of Methods is warranted, it may be that they are used for manual mapping of behaviors while the higher-level behaviors are used by automated analysis systems (which is not to say that some Methods could not be identified automatically).

* **If malware displays only some characteristics defining a behavior, it is correct to say it exhibits the behavior?**

Yes. In many cases, malware will display only a subset of a Behavior's characteristics. For example, the [System Information Discovery](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/blob/master/discovery/system-info-discovery.md) behavior includes discovery of a hostname, operating system version, patch information, processor architecture, etc. Malware that gathers only a hostname would still be said to exhibit the System Information Discovery Behavior.
