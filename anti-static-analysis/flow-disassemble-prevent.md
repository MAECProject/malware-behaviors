Defeat Flow-oriented Disassembler
=================================
Defeats disassembly of the malware instance in a flow-oriented (recursive traversal) disassembler. Some methods also relate to [Defeat Linear Disassembler](https://github.com/MAECProject/malware-behaviors/tree/master/anti-static-analysis/linear-disassemble-prevent.md).

Methods
-------
* **Conditional Misdirection**: Conditional jumps are sometimes used to confuse disassembly engines, resulting in the wrong instruction boundaries and thus wrong mnemonic and operands; identified when jmp/jcc to a label+# (e.g., JNE loc_401345fe+2).
* **Value Dependent Jumps**: Explicit use of computed values for control flow, often many times in the same basic block or function.
