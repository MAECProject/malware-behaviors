|**Name**|Virtualized Code|
|**Tactic**|Anti-static Analysis|
|**Description**|Virtualizes original executable code by translating the code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. It then inserts a "stub" function to call the VM where the actual code was supposed to be ran. This makes static analysis and reverse engineering more difficult; dumped code wonâ€™t work without VM code. Could also include virtualized packer stub code.|
|**Methods**|* Multiple VMs: multiple virtual machines with different architectures (CISC, RISC, etc.) can be used inside of a single executable in order to make reverse engineering even more difficult.|
