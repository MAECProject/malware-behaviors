Defeat Disassembler
===================
Defeats disassembly of the malware instance in a recursive or linear disassembler. 

Methods
-------
* **Conditional Misdirection**: Conditional jumps are sometimes used to confuse disassembly engines, resulting in the wrong instruction boundaries and thus wrong mnemonic and operands; identified when jmp/jcc to a label+# (e.g., JNE loc_401345fe+2).
* **Value Dependent Jumps**: Explicit use of computed values for control flow, often many times in the same basic block or function.
* **Argument Obfuscation**: simple number or string arguments to API calls are calculated at runtime, making linear disassembly more difficult.
* **Variable Recomposition**: Variables, often strings, are broken into multiple parts and store out of order, in different memory ranges, or both. They must then be recomposed before use.
