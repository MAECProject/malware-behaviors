| Stuxnet| February 2011| Stuxnet made the centrifuges at Iran's nuclear plant spin dangerously fast for 15 minutes, before returning to normal speed. About a month later, it slowed the centrifuges down for 50 minutes. This was repeated for several months, and over time the strain destroyed the machines. [[1]](#1)|
